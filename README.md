Object detection in Sub-T environments.

This repository hosts the files of the project *Convolutional neural networks for object detection in subterranean environments*, which aims to explore the capabilities of different state-of-the-art object detectors in the task of detecting some of the DARPA Sub-t Challenge artifacts from image data.

### Project breakdown
- **Research**: Gather knowledge on the field of neural networks and object detection. Identify state of the art object detection models and search for implementations backed-up by original research papers that are available for use.  
- **Data gathering**: Produce different datasets to train a model able to identify a specific set of items from pictures.   
- **Training and benchmarking**: Train different neural network models on the gathered data and evaluate and compare their performance on the object detection task.  
- **Deployment**: TBD
